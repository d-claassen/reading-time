## Releases

Releases are automatically created via GitHub Actions whenever a milestone is closed.
All pull requests need to be attached to a milestone when closed.
The pull requests can use different labels to end up in a specific section of the changelog.
The changelog will contain the following sections, with matching labels:

| Title                                            | Label                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| ":star: New Features"                            | "enhancement"                          |
| ":lady_beetle: Bug Fixes"                        | "regression" or "bug"                  |
| ":notebook_with_decorative_cover: Documentation" | "documentation"                        |
| ":hammer: Dependency Upgrades"                   | "dependency-upgrade" or "dependencies" |
